    <p>
      EmptyBars.org was created with a purpose to help musicians to study new
      musical pieces. Many musical teachers advise their students to learn
      compositions by splitting them into sections and then studying each
      section individually. (E.g.{" "}
      <a
        href="https://www.libertyparkmusic.com/learn-music-quickly/#p4"
        target="_blank"
        rel="noreferrer"
      >
        here
      </a>{" "}
      or{" "}
      <a
        href="https://youtu.be/S-en1Bi7kwY?t=171"
        target="_blank"
        rel="noreferrer"
      >
        here
      </a>
      .)
    </p>
    <p>
      On this website, you can find musical compositions performed by excellent
      musicians and uploaded on YouTube. Each piece is split into sections, and
      each section is linked to a particular place in the sheet music for
      convenient studying.

      You could also split any YouTube video into sections by yourself, see{" "}
